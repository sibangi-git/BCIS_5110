        "This project helped us understand basic Python concepts. We practiced using for loops to go through a list of posts. We learned how to take user input with the input() function and change it to a number using int(). We used if, elif, and else statements to run different code based on the chosen platform. We also worked with basic math operations and used f-strings to format output with a set number of decimal places. Converting input to lowercase made it easier for users to enter text in any case, improving our understanding.\n",

Instead of searching through documentation or tutorials, we could get quick reminders, which sped up our coding process and let us focus more on the program's logic and structure. We also used AI to learn about error handling, though it wasnâ€™t included in the final version. Additionally, AI helped explain error messages, making it easier for us to understand and fix issues."
